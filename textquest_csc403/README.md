README

Run the full program through .src/main/java/com/textquest/Main.java
    • Progression relies on user input, so keep your eyes on the terminal!

**Testing**

The program can be run in two modes that can be toggled by accessing: 
'textquest_csc403/src/main/java/com/textquest/Utilities/TestToggle.java'

• To run junit tests set TESTTOGGLE to true.
• For a full playthrough TESTTOGGLE should be set to false.

junit tests can be accessed by entering 'mvn test'
The relative classpath for automated junit tests is 'textquest_csc403/src/test/java'
Tests can be run with the command $ mvn tests or through your IDE
